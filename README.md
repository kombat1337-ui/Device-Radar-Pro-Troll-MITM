# üî• Device Pro + Troll + MITM üî•

A full-featured network reconnaissance and manipulation toolkit with:
- **ARP scanner** with interface selection & fallback  
- **ARP spoofing** (Start/Stop)  
- **ICMP ping & TCP/UDP port scan**  
- **Real-time network map** (via NetworkX + Matplotlib)  
- **MITM-style HTML injection** (using `mitmdump`)  
- **UDP ‚Äútrolling‚Äù** messages to discovered hosts  
- **Configurable scan interval, custom injection, logging**  
- **Cross-platform**: Windows & Unix (Mac/Linux)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

1. **Dynamic interface selector** (filters out virtual/WFP adapters)  
2. **Automatic subnet detection** & manual override  
3. **Threaded ARP scan** with fallback to system default interface  
4. **Deep host info** via optional Nmap OS detection & service scan  
5. **Live device list** with latency, ports, vendor, OS, services  
6. **Interactive network graph** (if `networkx` installed)  
7. **ARP spoofing** against any selected host  
8. **Custom command injector** (send UDP/TCP payloads)  
9. **UDP troll messages** on multiple ports with success/fail report  
10. **MITM proxy** via external `mitmdump` and user-defined HTML injection  
11. **GUI logging**, copy-to-clipboard, full-screen toggle  
12. **Config file** (`config.json`) for ports, colors, intervals, injection

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone the repo**
Create a virtualenv & install dependencies
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

Required system tools
Windows: run as Administrator, install WinPcap/Npcap
Unix (Linux/macOS): run with sudo, ensure libpcap
MITM proxy: install mitmproxy (pip install mitmproxy)
(Optional) Nmap (nmap CLI) & Python python-nmap
(Optional) NetworkX & Matplotlib



USAGE 
Interface: select your network adapter
Subnet: default auto-detect, override if needed
Rescan: manual ARP discovery
Devices tab: view live hosts, select one
Start/Stop Spoof
Send Cmd: inject custom UDP/TCP payloads
Troll: send a ‚ÄúYou have been spotted‚Äù message to open UDP ports
Network Map tab: visual graph of gateway ‚Üî devices
MITM Proxy
Start MITM Proxy: launches mitmdump -p 8080 with your injection script
Inj HTML: edit the HTML snippet to inject
Apply: regenerate script for next proxy run
Press F11 for full-screen toggle.
